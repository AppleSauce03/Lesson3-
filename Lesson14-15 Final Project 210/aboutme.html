    <P class="about"> Hello! MY name is Ian M. Pulido, and this is little about me! 
        I am 22 year old and have taking many interests in learning web development, data science, and I.T. concepts. 
        I am a North Carolina native, Research Triangle Park citizen for my entire life. I have two German Shepards, named Kylo and Anya, which both of them are siblings.
        Some of my things I would like to do into the future involve with help managing company's cyber infrastructure and assist in the health of said infrastructure.
        Some Day I will become a certified cybersercurity expert, web developer, and computer programmer. 
        I enjoy lifting weights, traveling (when I can), appreciating nature through hikes, walks, biking, and sightseeing, Spending quality time with people I care about, and cooking!
